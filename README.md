# Crime-Mapping-Dhaka
A website which would contain the map of Dhaka where people would be able to pin a
location for a crime that had occurred to them in that area. A description would be attached
to the pins where the victims will describe the crime - time & date of crime, nature of crime,
whether it was reported or not, etc. Users can see the pins and know which areas are more
riskier. They would also be able to filter the pins based on time of day, date range - to see
which were more recent crimes. Hence this map would help users to be aware and take
necessary precautions, it would also help the police to know which areas are more crime
prone and hence increase patrols there to protect citizens.
Similar systems exist around the globe but this system is different because the pins are
posted by the victims themselves anonymously. The other systems are managed by police
departments but in our country, Bangladesh, most petty crimes and sexual harassments go unreported
due to various reasons. This system can help more people share their incidents and help stay safe.
